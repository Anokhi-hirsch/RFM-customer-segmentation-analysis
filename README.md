# Customer Segmentation Analysis Using RFM  
## Objective  
The purpose of this project is to conduct a Customer Segmentation Analysis for an Automobile bike Company. Customer segmentation is performed by developing an RFM Model. RFM analysis is a behavior-based approach to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. This segmentation will help identify different customer groups and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
Customer segmentation can help businesses in many ways, including targeted marketing, customer retention, efficiency and improved customer satisfaction. By organizing customers into distinct groups based upon shared characteristics, we can gauge and respond to their needs in strategic ways that help them get the most out of the product and best meet their needs.
